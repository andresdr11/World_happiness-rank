## Objective
The main objective is to explore and understand patterns and relationships present in happiness data. The goal is to identify trends over the years, analyze the influence of various variables, and provide a comprehensive view of happiness globally.

## Process
* Data Loading: Data from the 2015 and 2016 Happiness Reports is imported from CSV files.

* Data Consolidation: Both datasets are combined to create a unified dataframe, facilitating comparative analysis.

* Handling Null Values: Null values in certain columns are addressed using specific strategies to preserve data integrity.

* Visual Exploration: Graphs are utilized to visualize key relationships, such as the influence of family on health and the correlation between happiness score and trust in the government.

* Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis is performed to understand the distribution and variability of variables, excluding null values.

* Correlation Matrix: A correlation matrix is calculated to identify potential associations between variables.

* Data Grouping: The dataframe is grouped by country, highlighting the maximum happiness value regardless of the year.

* Relationship Exploration: The relationship between happiness and generosity is investigated, visually exploring freedom score.

* Distopia Distribution: The distribution of distopia grade based on region is analyzed, providing a contextualized perspective.
